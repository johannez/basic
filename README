Style module support

********************************************************************
DESCRIPTION:
 
Simple basic theme with style module support. Written in HTML 3.2 
(without CSS) for old, 'none-screen', and simple browsers. Support 
for right and/or left side columns (only one table). Minimal design, 
nothing fancy. For small pages, fast rendering, and backwards 
compatibility.

********************************************************************
INSTALLATION: 

Copy the basic/ theme directory into your drupal themes/ 
directory. Enable the theme in your administration settings. 

If you want to tweak the colors and some other things easily in 
the admin section, install and enable the style module. Or you 
can change some vars in the basic.inc file in the Basic theme 
directory.

Replace themes/basic/images/logo.gif with your own logo. 
In the style module admin section ('expert' mode) you can also 
hide the logo, and add your own header text. You can change 
the image type (file extension) in the style module admin 
section ('expert' mode).

The Basic theme supports a left side column for blocks by default.
To support right side blocks, you first have to set the column 
width key in the style admin settings ('expert' mode). You can 
disable or hide the left and/or right column by setting its width 
to zero, or disabling all the columns. This can also be done in 
the basic.inc file.

See the help link in the style module administration section 
for further instructions on how to change the look of the theme.
